        <div class="header firstheader smaller">what is mist?</div>
        <div class="description bigger">mist is a place to make <strong>real connections</strong> through <strong>anonymous posts</strong>.</div>
        <div class="header followheader">how does mist work?</div>
        <div class="description bigger"><strong>post an anonymous “mist”<br /></strong><br />brighten someone’s day or get a second chance by posting a mist. your profile is entirely hidden— safely write about them without others knowing it’s you.<br /><br /><strong>help your friends find their mists<br /></strong><br />see a mist about your friend? tag them in the comments and we’ll let them know.<br /><br /><strong>make real connections<br /></strong>‍<br />find a mist about you? dm the author! the author can see your profile and choose to accept your dm. if they accept, their profile is also revealed and you can start chatting.</div>
        <div class="header followheader">what kind of things should i mist about?</div>
        <div class="description bigger">post a mist to anonymously reach out to someone you know or saw in real life.<br /><br /><strong>here are some &quot;mistable moments&quot;:<br /></strong>‍<br />- the kind stranger who held the door for you at Starbucks<br />‍<br />- your WRIT-150 classmate with the amazing style<br />‍<br />- that cutie at the party last night whose number you didn’t get<br />‍<br /><strong>use a daily prompt as inspiration<br /></strong>‍<br />- someone who you’ve meant to reach out to<br />‍<br />- your friend crush<br />‍<br />- a cute stranger you see ALL the time around campus<br /></div>
        <div class="header followheader">how is mist different from other social media apps?</div>
        <div class="description bigger"><strong>in the words of our mist community:<br /></strong>‍<br />- “mist is more authentic—each post starts with your own personal connection + reaching out”<br />‍<br />- “i love coming across mists that might be about my friends”<br />‍<br />- “it’s unique how you can reach out anonymously and then reveal yourself later”<br />‍<br />- “the stories &amp; letters people write are so damn good”<br /><br /><strong>we couldn’t have said it better ourselves :) on mist:<br /></strong>‍<br />- posts feel more genuine since you reach out to those who know or saw in real life.<br />‍<br />- connections feel more meaningful since they went out of their way to write you a mist.<br />‍<br />- kindness feels more widespread since you can see the underground network of compliments.</div>
        <div class="header followheader">what inspired mist?</div>
        <div class="description bigger">there’s sites like Craigslist where you can post about your “missed connection.”there’s apps like Reddit where you can post anonymously about anything. <br /><br />but there was no app to reach out anonymously with the intent of connecting in real life.…until mist :)</div>
        <div class="header followheader">when am i anonymous?</div>
        <div class="description bigger">when you post a mist, you’re 100% anonymous. at all other times, you’re not anonymous. more specifically:<br />‍<br />- when you <strong>post </strong>a mist, you’re <strong>100% anonymous</strong>. share your thoughts without anyone knowing it’s you.<br />‍<br />- when you <strong>reply </strong>to a mist, you’re <strong>not anonymous.</strong> the author can see your profile and choose whether to accept your dm.<br />‍<br />- when you <strong>comment</strong> on a mist, you’re <strong>not anonymous.</strong> your friends can tag you if they find one about you.</div>
        <div class="header followheader">someone replied to my mist! now how can I trust who they are?</div>
        <div class="description bigger">we verify that each mister is a <strong>usc student </strong>by checking their <strong>usc email</strong> upon signing up.<br /><br />we ensure everyone has only <strong>one account </strong>by associating it with their <strong>phone number</strong>.<br /><br />soon, we’ll be offering <strong>profile verification</strong> by confirming your profile pic with a selfie.<br /><br />when you start chatting with someone, you can be sure that they really are who they say they are.</div>
        <div class="header followheader">how are mists organized?</div>
        <div class="description bigger">on the <strong>feed</strong>, you can always find more mists if you scroll further down.<br /><br />on the <strong>map</strong>, you can only see the top 100 “trending”, “new”, or “best” mists in a given area.<br /><br />you can always view your <strong>favorites, mentions</strong> and <strong>submissions </strong>under your account.</div>
        <div class="header followheader">what are mist’s goals?</div>
        <div class="description bigger">at mist, our mission is to be a place where real connections can form through anonymous posts. each feature we add and each decision we make is in this direction.<br /><br />we all appreciate when someone writes kind words about us or takes an interest in us. we hope mist becomes a place you can spread this feeling by posting about those you know or saw in real life. a place where you can make your friend’s day, take a chance on your missed connection, and help you friends connect with others.</div>
        <div class="header followheader">how can i share my feedback?</div>
        <div class="description bigger">we’re always looking to hear from the mist community and incorporate your feedback into the app.<br /><br />fill out our <a href="https://forms.gle/6mKUSePto3E4GDzg6" class="link-2">mist feedback form</a> or email us at whatsup@getmist.app</div>
